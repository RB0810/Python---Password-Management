# Python---Password-Management
encryption, decryption, md5 hashing - bruteforce

**What is this project about?** <br>
The project is about password processing.<br>
There are three ways in which a server stores a password:<br>
a. Plain Text<br>
b. Encryption and Decryption<br>
c. Hashes (retrieved by brute-force attack)<br>
This project covers the encryption, decryption and the hash techniques (plain
text being quite self-explanatory). I have developed the algorithm for each of
the techniques. It allows users to access and test any of the password
processing steps. Entering the password and viewing the encryption key,
verifying to check whether the encryption key on decryption gives back the
password. Looking at the MD5 Hash encryption and its associated brute-force
attack.

**Why this project?**<br>
In todays world where cyber crime is at its peak, where hackers easily crack
passwords to access your personal data, where the security of a site is being
questioned always and where people fear having personal information online,
it is important to educate them. This project serves this purpose. It tells users
the exact ways of how password is processed, which makes them aware of
what can be available to hackers. This understanding can help users create a
password strong enough such that it is not an easy target for hackers, helping
them secure their online activities.

**Minimum Requirements**<br>
a. Hashlib module python 3<br>
b. Zip file archived in ZIP 64 extension<br>
c. Zip module python 3<br>
